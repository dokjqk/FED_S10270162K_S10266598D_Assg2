# MokeSell: Online Platform for Buying and Selling Goods

Welcome to MokeSell, an online bookstore platform that allows users to buy and sell both new and second-hand books. This project involves the development of an **Interactive Web Application** where users can browse, list, and purchase items. 

## Project Overview
MokeSell is designed to be a user-friendly platform for both buyers and sellers. It supports two main user roles:
- **Buyers** can browse through available items, view product details, and make purchases.
- **Sellers** can list new and second-hand books, manage their listings.

### Key Features:
- User Registration: Allows users to create an account, log in, and securely manage their information.
- Product Listings: Sellers can list products with details such as name, price, condition (new/second-hand), description, and images.
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop use
- Add review to seller/buyer
- AI chatbox to answer user questions.

## Installation

To set up this project locally, follow the instructions below.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dokjqk/FED_S10270162K_S10266598D_Assg2.git
   cd mokesell

## User Audience Intent & Purpose

MokeSell is designed for individuals who are interested in buying or selling books, whether new or used. The primary purpose of the platform is to offer a convenient, online marketplace for:

- **Book buyers** who wish to purchase new or second-hand books at competitive prices.
- **Book sellers** (including individuals, or bookstores) who want to list and sell their books to a wide audience.
- **Easy lising process** Seller can put up items for sale.
- **Direct messaging between seller and buyer** User can interact directly through the website itself.

## Design Process

We wanted a website similar to Carousell and Ebay but for books. We wanted the website to be easy to navigate and rather pleasing to look at.
We also thought of how the navigation feels like for the users.

## Wireframe

The initial wireframes and design mockups were created using **Figma**.
- **Figma share link**: [[Figma link](https://www.figma.com/design/M4vPMyuS8tFMi6d3eExeUi/Untitled?node-id=0-1&t=TOScV1YFE8sMpeMc-1)]

## Technology Used

MokeSell is built using a combination of modern web technologies to ensure a seamless user experience:

- **Front-End**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for building an interactive and responsive interface.
- **Database**: RestDB, a cloud-based NoSQL database for managing product listings and user data.
- **AI Integration**: Gemini AI for powering the chatbox and enhancing user support.

## Assistive AI

I used Generative AI to help me with some of the redirect options, AI chatbox implementation and the restdb implementation, listing implementation and to fix minor formating issues.
